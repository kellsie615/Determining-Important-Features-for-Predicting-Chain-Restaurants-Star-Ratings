# Determining-Important-Features-for-Predicting-Chain-Restaurants-Star-Ratings
SML312 Final Project

This is my final project for SML312: Research in Data Science taught by Professor Jon Hanke.

An important goal for any restaurant is to obtain a high star rating on crowd-sourced review websites (e.g. Yelp and Google Reviews) in order to boost reputation and attract customers and earn more revenue. The dilemma is that these restaurants need to balance between budgeting their capital well and keeping customers happy. One solution is to hone in on a few features that will maximize the probability of customers having a good, satisfying experience.

Thus, this project aims to answer the questions of what features are the most important in predicting a chain restaurantâ€™s star rating on Yelp.
